# ðŸŽ¯ Student Performance Predictor

A supervised learning project that predicts whether a student will **Pass** or **Fail** based on their GPA, study time, and absences.  
Implemented using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifiers, with evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, and confusion matrix visualizations.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

ðŸ“Š **Goal:** Predict student success (Pass/Fail) to understand the impact of factors such as:
- ðŸ“š **Study time** per week
- ðŸš« **Absences**
- ðŸŽ¯ **GPA**

âœ… Compared two classification models:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree

âœ… Evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Confusion matrices

âœ… Visualized:
- Logistic Regression feature impact (coefficients)
- Decision Tree splits

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset

Used a **Kaggle Student Performance dataset**, which includes columns like:

- `Age`, `StudyTimeWeekly`, `Absences`
- `GPA` (final grade on a 0-4 scale)
- `Tutoring`, `ParentalSupport`, `Extracurricular` (for potential future work)

The target variable was engineered as:
